The dtd file has been designed to verify the same document structure of schema file,
(watch schema doc for details about structure), due to the limits of dtd no many constraints can be checked.
In particular was not possible to define name of nodes and links as ID type because they can be repeated
in different NFFGs, furthermore the ID type covers only uniqueness not syntax constraints.

Constraints checked in the dtd:
-NFFG have a name that's unique in the document
-Policies have a name that's unique in the document
-Policies attribute "nffg" is of type IDREF so should point to an existing ID
(but there is no way to verify that it points to an NFFG)
-Node attribute "type" must have a correct syntax referencing a defined functionalType.
-if a policy is verified it should have elements: result, message, date (but no way to check that they are not empty).
